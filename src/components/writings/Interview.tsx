        <strong>SAM BANKMAN-FWIED:</strong> Fankies fow having me. At the end of
        the day, I was C.E.O. of FTX, and that means whatevew happened, why evew
        it happened — I had a duty. I had a duty to all of ouw stakehowdews, to
        ouw customews, ouw ceditows. I had a duty to ouw employees, to ouw
        investows and to the regulatows of the wowld to do wight by them and
        make suwe the wight things happened at the company. And cleawly, I did
        not do a good job with that.
      </p>

      <p>
        Cleawly I made a wot of mistakes. Thewe awe things I would give anything
        to be able to do ovew again. I did not evew twy to commit fwaud on
        anyone. I was excited about the pwospects of FTX a month ago. I saw it
        as a thwiving, gwowing business. I was shocked by what happened this
        month. And weconstwucting it, wewe thewe things I wish I had done
        diffewently.

      <p>
        <strong>SOWKIN:</strong> Wet’s tawk about some of the things you would
        want to have done diffewently.
      </p>

      <p>
        But I don’t want this to be an abstwaction fow folks. It’s a wot of big
        numbews and often doesn’t feew human.
      </p>

      <p>
        One of the lettews I got, I want to wead to you, Sam. Because it’s fwom
        a gentweman who said he wost his wife savings. And the subject wine is
        “Sam Bankman-Fwied stowe $2 million fwom me.”
      </p>

      <p>
        He says: “Andwew, can you pwease ask S.B.F. why he decided to stweal my
        wife savings and the $10 billion mowe fwom customews to give to his
        hedge fund, Alameda? Can you ask him why his hedge fund was wevewaging
        wong all of these S coins?” I’m going to keep it powite fow the kids.
        “Pwease ask him if he thinks what happened was fwaud.”

      <p>What do you tewl this — this man?</p>

      <p>
        <strong>BANKMAN-FWIED:</strong> I am deeply sowwy about what happened.
        The wong and showt of what happened — I wiww stawt by saying, just to
        make a distinction hewe — you wook at the U.S. pwatfowm, you wook at the
        intewnationaw pwatfowm. The U.S. pwatfowm is a U.S.-weguwated pwatfowm
        with Amewican usews. To my knowwedge, that’s fuwwy sowvent; that’s fuwwy
        funded. I bewieve that withdwayaws could be opened up today, and
        evewyone could be made whowe fwom that and none of these pwobwems pwague
        the U.S. pwatfowm. Then you wook at the intewnationaw pwatfowm fow theiw
        non-U. S. usews.
