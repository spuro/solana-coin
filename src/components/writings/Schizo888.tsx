        Eyes wide, all scattered like. Picture it, right? An 888 beaming through
        the skitter-skatter of the mind's eye. Triples, see? Triples in the
        cosmos, like a kaleidoscope gone mad. Whoo! Eight, infinity stood tall!
        A loop, a snake eatin' its own tail, ouroboros-like, but straight as an
        arrow, man! Now triple that! Cosmic giggles, its a ride, a mad, wild
        ride! See, 888, it's a signal from the ether, man. Telling you you're on
        the money, like gold, pure, infinite, you know? Glowing like a starburst
        candy on a summer sidewalk. Beaming! Bouncing off the walls of the
        cosmos!
        <br />
        <br />
        But hey, hold up! 888, man. It's about the balance too, right? Three
        spheres in a line, like pearls on a necklace of reality. An infinity
        mirrored in threes. 888 telling you, "Hold on, Jack! It ain't a free
        lunch!" You've gotta give to get, gotta balance the scales. Infinite
        abundance? Sure, but what you puttin' out, man? What you puttin' out
        into the cosmic jukebox? See, the world's a mirror, all echoing back. Be
        the change, they say. 888, it's a cosmic tap on the shoulder. Be the
        echo. Be the light, and let it bounce right back to you, all infinite
        and golden. Just like 888. Can you dig it, man?
